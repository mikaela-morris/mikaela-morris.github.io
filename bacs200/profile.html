    <p>I was born and raised in Clovis, a small town in the Central Valley of California. I am a Senior Business Management major and also pursuing a minor in Deaf Education. While being a full time student, I am an Infant teacher at Kiddie Academy of Erie. During the summer months, I am an office manager and infant/toddler swim instructor at Amy Morris Swim School in Clovis, CA. After graduation, I am planning to move to Wyoming with my hopeful fiance and continue our small business ventures.</p>
