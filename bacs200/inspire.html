        When choosing someone who inspires me, I looked for someone that carries similar etiquette. I wish to be a role model for the younger generation. be a woman of my word and advocate for what I believe in no matter if it fits the worldly narrative or not. Sadie embodies all these aspects as an American actress, reality tv star, and Christian wife and mom. I started following sadie's journey a few years back because of her religious and moral views. She wishes to be a role model for younger women. As for myself, working with young children has taught me from a young age to carry myself with high integrity, be a woman of my word, and to be caring and have courage.

        I believe the three aspects below are what I look for in an inspirational person. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High integrity- act like somone is always watching</li>
        <li>Motivational- be a great leader, but remain humble and genuine</li>
        <li>Relationship builder- welcoming to others and easily get along with those around them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More recently, these have become dearer to me because of my passion for teaching young children. Many celebrities now lose sight on their following rather than focusing on their mission and reaching the youth. I hope many continue inspiring like Sadie and continue to be a light for women and the youth.
