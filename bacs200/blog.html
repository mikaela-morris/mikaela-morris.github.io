    <h1>Vaccines.. Mandate or Not?</h1>
    <p>Vaccines have revolutionized global health with life-saving immunity from certain diseases. Diseases and viruses like smallpox, polio, and tetanus are no longer deadly because of innovative vaccines. This all being said, the Covid-19 vaccine was developed under President Trump through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer became the first to approve a Covid-19 vaccine just a year after the virus was first identified. This is where many people became skeptical about the vaccine's effectiveness. Thus, causing high tensions and debates between those who are willing and able to receive the vaccine and those who are not.</p>

      <h2>Social Implications</h2>
      <p>Education, mental health, and so much more imapcted the social atmosphere throughout the globe. Education was impacted because most schools and universities shut down and resorted to all online learning aspect. This was great for some, but in all seriousness Education is not the same without an in-person aspect, especially college for various reasons. When talking about mental health, anxiety, depression, and suicide rates were at an all time high throughout the pandemic. The younger generations, in my personal opinion, were impacted the most. Along with the mental health issues, fear was instilled in many thanks to the mass media. Many people wouldn't leave their homes or return to work simply out of fear for themselves or someone else. Bottomline of this situation, you take risks in your life every single day and you have to weigh your options on what is most important to you and your family.</p>

      <h2>Economical Implications</h2>
      <p>Covid-19 impacted America's economy negatively. Why? Because many people were cautious, businesses provided pay cuts and allowed most if not all within their organization/company to work from home (remotely). For obvious reasons, many quit their jobs or filed for unemployment. Now, each state decided to go about the management of Covid in a different manor. A great example of an economic failure on a state basis would be California. Governor Gavin Newsom of California instilled the strictest lockdowns and mandates within the United States from the very beginning. However, California continued to rank within the Top 3 of the most recorded Covid-19 cases throughout the pandemic. Newsom also instilled a statewide Vaccine Mandate. California also provided 3 rounds of stimulus checks. Yes, 3. From a bigger picture standpoint, this encouraged people to take advantage and stay home on unployment or continue working from home. For the working middle class, this was pathetic because work isn't supposed to be ssitting on a coach, collecting free money. Quite frankly, many within the working middle class category didn't receive a stimulus check or may have gotten just 1 of the 3 distributed.</p>

      <h2>Political Implications</h2>
      <p>Because Governor Gavin Newsom cracked down hard in hopes to improve his state through the pandemic, many Californians tapped back and voted to recall Newsom purely on for a lack of choice amongst the people. This caused much political outrage because of the dollar signs the media fails to tell everyone about. Big Pharm and the Government are making billions off the American people from Covid tests and vaccines. Newsom really didn't and still doesn't value his people in California. Why? Newsom has been seen at various major events including the Super Bowl without a mask. It has been a "for thee, not for me" mentality from Gavin. They hypocrisy is beyond many. Looking at the country as a whole, many who haven't received the vaccine(s) identify with the Repulican or Libertarian parties. Many who have received the vaccine(s), claim to associate with the Democratic party. This is not saying that in every circumstance this is the case, this is just a broad picture narrative throughout the US. As you can see, political tensions arise from this. Fingers are pointed at those who are done wearing a mask and vise-versa for those who do still wear one. Again, there is no ability to have a civil debate amongst most.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, most prefer to live by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; that is the Freedom of Choice. Part of what makes America great, is having the freedom to choose what is best for you, your health, and your family, not others deciding or dictating for you.</p>
