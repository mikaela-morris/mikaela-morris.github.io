				<h1>Vaccines.. Mandate or Not?</h1>
				<p>Vaccines have revolutionized global health with life-saving immunity from certain diseases. Diseases and viruses like smallpox, polio, and tetanus are no longer deadly because of innovative vaccines. This all being said, the Covid-19 vaccine was developed under President Trump through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer became the first to approve a Covid-19 vaccine just a year after the virus was first identified. This is where many people became skeptical about the vaccine's effectiveness. Thus, causing high tensions and debates between those who are willing and able to receive the vaccine and those who are not.</p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>Covid-19 impacted America's economy negatively. Why? Because many people were cautious, businesses provided pay cuts and allowed most if not all within their organization/company to work from home (remotely). For obvious reasons, many quit their jobs or filed for unemployment. Now, each state decided to go about the management of Covid in a different manor. A great example of an economic failure on a state basis would be California. Governor Gavin Newsom of California instilled the strictest lockdowns and mandates within the United States from the very beginning. However, California continued to rank within the Top 3 of the most recorded Covid-19 cases throughout the pandemic. He also instilled a statewide Vaccine Mandate. </p>
