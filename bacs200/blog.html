				<h1>Vaccines.. Mandate or Not?</h1>
				<p>Vaccines have revolutionized global health with life-saving immunity from certain diseases. Diseases and viruses like smallpox, polio, and tetanus are no longer deadly because of innovative vaccines. This all being said, the Covid-19 vaccine was developed under President Trump through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer became the first to approve a Covid-19 vaccine just a year after the virus was first identified. This is where many people became skeptical about the vaccine's effectiveness. Thus, causing high tensions and debates between those who are willing and able to receive the vaccine and those who are not.</p>
