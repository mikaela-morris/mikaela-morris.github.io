        Amy Morris Swim School is a Spring & Summer swim school offering private swim instruction. Aside from opening her own swim school in 2002, Amy swam at the National and Collegiate levels. Upon graduating from college, Amy developed a love for little ones and wished to carry on her passion for the sport of swimming. AMSS specializes in teaching infants and toddlers water safety and educating their family of its importance. AMSS offers the most efficient swim instruction in the central valley of California. How? Owner, Amy and her staff, do this by teaching with a balance of love and discipline.
